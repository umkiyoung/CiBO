# üöÄ Posterior Inference in Latent Space for Scalable Constrained Black-box Optimization (CiBO)

This repository implements the CiBO method presented in our paper **"Posterior Inference in Latent Space
for Scalable Constrained Black-box Optimization"**. CiBO leverages diffusion models to perform efficient posterior inference and amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the latent space
of flow-based models, achieving superior performance on various **synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization** tasks. 

For a visual explanation of the CiBO framework, please see the image below:

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To include the CiBO repository in your Python path, add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
# Open your shell configuration file
nano ~/.bashrc  # or nano ~/.zshrc

# Add the following line (replace /home/name/CiBO with your path)
export PYTHONPATH=/home/name/CiBO:$PYTHONPATH
```

After editing, reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Alternatively, add the same export line to the top of [`baselines/scripts/cibo.sh`](baselines/scripts/cibo.sh).
